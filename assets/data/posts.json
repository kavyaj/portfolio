      "content": "# Building Resumey.Pro: Lessons from My First SaaS\n\nAfter spending years in traditional design roles, I made the leap to build my own product. Resumey.Pro started as a simple idea: what if creating a professional resume could be as easy as filling out a form?\n\n## The Journey\n\nThe development process taught me several key lessons:\n\n### 1. Start with the Problem\nI spent too much time on features nobody asked for. The real breakthrough came when I started talking to users daily.\n\n### 2. Design Systems Matter\nBuilding a consistent design system from day one saved countless hours later in development.\n\n### 3. User Feedback is Gold\nEvery piece of feedback, positive or negative, helped shape the product into something people actually wanted to use.\n\n## What's Next\n\nBuilding Resumey.Pro was just the beginning. The experience has opened my eyes to the possibilities of combining design thinking with entrepreneurial spirit.",

      "content": "# The Art of Design Systems\n\nDesign systems have become the backbone of modern product development. But what makes a design system truly effective?\n\n## More Than Components\n\nA good design system is:\n- **Consistent**: Visual and interaction patterns that users can predict\n- **Scalable**: Components that work across different contexts\n- **Accessible**: Built with inclusivity in mind from the start\n- **Living**: Continuously evolving based on team needs\n\n## Building for the Future\n\nThe best design systems I've worked with treat documentation as a first-class citizen. When developers can understand the 'why' behind design decisions, magic happens.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n1. Start small and grow organically\n2. Invest in tooling and automation\n3. Make adoption easy for your team\n4. Measure success through usage, not just completion",

      "excerpt": "The transition from big company design to startup hustle taught me more about product thinking than any course could.",
      "content": "# From Corporate to Startup: A Designer's Perspective\n\nMoving from a large corporation to the startup world was like learning to design all over again.\n\n## Corporate vs Startup Design\n\n### Corporate\n- Extensive research phases\n- Multiple stakeholder approvals\n- Risk-averse decision making\n- Resource abundance\n\n### Startup\n- Ship first, research later\n- Direct access to users\n- Comfortable with uncertainty\n- Resource constraints breed creativity\n\n## What I Learned\n\nThe biggest shift was learning to embrace uncertainty. In corporate environments, I was used to having all the answers before starting. In startups, you learn as you build.\n\n## The Sweet Spot\n\nThe ideal approach combines the best of both worlds:\n- Corporate's emphasis on research and process\n- Startup's speed and user proximity\n\nThis hybrid approach has made me a more well-rounded designer and product thinker.",

      "excerpt": "A reflection on how we've transferred our cognitive load to AI, and what it means for the next generation who will grow up never knowing life without it.",
      "content": "# We were the AI before AI became a thing.\n\nThere will come a day when my son will look at me, half-curious, half-judgy and ask,\n\"Waitâ€¦ you people actually searched the internetâ€¦ without AI?\"\n\nI can't wait for him to sit down with his grandma for that one. I can already see her face. The same look she had when I once said Maggi takes too long. She'll try to explain a time when there was no internet. He'll look at her like she's describing life before oxygen.\n\nIn all fairness, it's as alien to him as telegram is to me (the OG one, not the one with a capital T)\n\nThis thought occurs to me as I transfer all my cognitive load to Perplexity as I type \"I see error E4 on my Toshiba dishwasher. What do I do?\"\n\nI can feel my mom's years of trying to make me resourceful evaporating.\n\nIs searching on Google such an uphill task now?\n\nI often surprise myself with the degree of laziness that comes with my questions.\n\nNo doubt I'm still the curious type. The type some people used to find annoying because I asked too many \"why\" questions.\n\nBut adulthood has slowly transformed the whys to hows and whats.\n\n\"How do I get this done.\"\n\n\"What should I do about this.\"\n\nGetting things done. Chop chop.\n\nI tinker with the dishwasher and tell myself maybe one day we won't have to do dishes at all. Like Mrs. Weasley's magical sink where a sponge floats around scrubbing plates.\n\nMaybe we're doing this all wrong. Instead of going down the technological advancements route, we should have picked the magical one instead.\n\nImagine if we could just apparate anywhere. We'd save a lot of carbon footprint on travel, for sure.\n\nBut since no one's figured out magic yet, we settled for AI.\n\nAnd I guess when my son is old enough to ask me that AI question, I'll flex and say, \"We were the AI before AI became a thing.\" ðŸ˜Ž",
